  This may happen if you're using rubygems as your package manager, but
  it is not beging required through some mechanism before executing the
  ol command.

  You may need to do one of the following in your shell:

    # for bash/zsh
    export RUBYOPTS=rubygems

    # for csh, &c.
    set RUBYOPTS=rubygems

  For background, please see <URI:http://gist.github.com/54177>.

#{'*'*73}
  EOS
  exit(1)
end
